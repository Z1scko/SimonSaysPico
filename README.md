A quick simon says project for Raspberry pi pico

# The rules
When you turn it up, click on a button to stat a game. The device will buzz. Repeat the color sequence in the order to win. The more you win, the harder it become: you wil have one more color to remember after each win.


Do not forget pull-down resistors for the buttons !

I printed the top part with transluscent PLA, which allows me to see LEDs through it. If you need a "personalized" version, I could do some small changes on the body.

I used Circuit Python 9.0.5 on a Raspberry Pi Pico.

It is one of my first full project, so if you have any recomendation, I'll take them :)
