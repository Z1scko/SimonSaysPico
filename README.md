# SimonSaysPico
A quick simon says project for Raspberry pi pico

Do not forget pull-down resistors for the buttons !

I printed the top part with transluscent PLA, which allows me to see LEDs through it. If you need a "personalized" version, I could do some small changes on the body.

I used Circuit Python 9.0.5 on a Raspberry Pi Pico.

It is one of my first full project, so if you have any recomendation, I'll take them :)
